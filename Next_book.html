          <b>Curious fact:</b> Seth was one of the few people with very early
          access to the<br />
          internet (when a 24-hour line still cost $400/month), and has been
          blogging ever<br />
          since. He’s published something every day for nearly 20 years,
          initially sending<br />
          his ideas out via email, then moving to Blogger, Google’s blogging
          platform. To<br />
          date, over 6,000 (!) blog posts are on his site, which attracts
          millions of readers<br />
          every month, and is often regarded as the #1 marketing blog in the
          world.<br />
          Finding it is easy. Just type ‘Seth’ into Google.

        <p><strong>Best quote from the book:</strong></p>
        <p>
          <br />
          You have only two good choices: Quit or be exceptional. Average is for
          losers.

          <b>Summary:</b> This is a book about choices. Two choices, really.
          It’s about the decision between quitting, or trying to be the best in
          the world. It starts with introducing you to the idea that being the
          best in the world is very underrated. On any top 10 list, number one
          gets far more than just its fair share of 10% (for example, the top
          result in Google gets ~40% of all clicks).<br />
          <br />
          But isn’t it almost impossible to become the best in the world today?
          No, because according to Seth, both “the world” and “best” are two
          very flexible terms and highly depend on what you do. He uses a few
          graphs and curves to explain when it’s time to make one of the two
          choices, and underlines them with several examples so you can get a
          better grip of which one to make when it’s your turn (and it’s always
          your turn). The book ends with a series of questions to help you
          figure out which dip to pursue, and which dead ends it’s time to quit.

        <h4>Why is it such a motivational book?</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          This book has had the biggest impact on me all year. It tells you that
          it’s okay to quit, that it’s actually important to do so, which makes
          this <strong>an unbelievably liberating book</strong>. All of a
          sudden, you won’t feel compelled to keep up with the digital and
          physical Joneses in your life, whether it’s that extra Twitter account
          that pulls at your attention, or the vain chase for the next promotion
          at a company you’ll never lead.<br /><br />
          The Dip is
          <strong>a call to greatness in a world of mediocrity.</strong> But
          greatness always entails sacrifice. Luckily, this book also gives you
          the courage and confidence to happily make those sacrifices, figure
          out your true mission, smile and return to work that matters.
