        <p><b>Title:</b> Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>
        <br />
        <p><b>Author:</b>Robert T. Kiyosaki</p>
        <br />
        <p><b>Type:</b> Non-fiction</p>
        <br />
        <p><b>Published in:</b> 1997</p>
        <br />
        <p><b>Number of copies sold:</b> ~26 million</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>Curious fact:</b> Both Kiyosaki and the book are highly
          controversial, not least<br />because Kiyosaki has declared bankruptcy
          himself multiple times (last in 2012).<br />Even though the book is
          always listed as non-fiction, Kiyosaki has insinuated<br />
          multiple times that his “rich dad” never existed.

        <p><strong>Best quote from the book:</strong></p>

          <br />
          When you want something, all the universe conspires to help you
          achieve it.

          <b>Summary:</b> The book starts with Kiyosaki re-telling the story of
          his childhood. His real dad, whom he considers to be his “poor dad”
          was an academic, who earned a decent living, but, according to him,
          never really understood some of the most important principles of
          money. He explains how the father of a friend took the two kids under
          his wings and taught them how businesses and money work, by having
          them work in one of his stores for next to nothing, but educating them
          about money in his spare time. The book then takes a turn and explains
          what “financial literacy” looks like, how you should approach your
          personal finances and work, what you can do to leverage taxes and laws
          to your advantage, before it ends with a few very practical first
          steps you can take.

        <h4>Why is it such a motivational book?</h4>
        <br />

          Some people love this book, others hate it. I love it. The story of
          Robert’s childhood (invented or not) is super inspiring, making the
          book worth a read regardless of the financial advice. Yet, the way it
          approaches personal finance is very simplistic, which
          <strong>gives you a sense of relief.</strong> Yes, his definitions of
          assets and liabilities might not be 100% accurate, but if you’ve never
          even understood them before, this’ll help.<br /><br />
          It’s more of a beginner’s book for sure, but it
          <strong>gets you in the right mindset for financial success,</strong>
          and shows you what you can do right now to start building wealth. For
          example, I used the book’s “pay yourself first” principle to instantly
          put away 10% of my income, and that alone felt pre.tty good
